*Made with intention to try out tools that make Parallel computing easy to implement.\
This program is made for learning purposes for university's Parallel Programming lecture's assignment.*

## Python dependencies

    pip install opencv-python

## Data structure

    data/*/a_image_you_like.png
    data/*/another_image.png
